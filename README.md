# vmod-lang
Langauge based on the concept of an 'environment'. An 'environment' is basically a named scope, where you declare what 'global' variables there are
initialize the environment, and call the environment to access its inside fields. You can see examples in the examples folder. There is a linked list. Currently there is no support for collections beyond that. I am working on building these into the standard library.
